Testing That Needs To Be Done
-------------------------------


1) Bridge bridge() calls
  params:
    BridgeParams calldata _bridgeParams
    bytes calldata _swapPayload
    bytes calldata _payloadData

  2 cases of bridge operations
    1) non-native token bridges

    2) native token bridges

  Two types of payloads result in two different operations on destination chain:
    1) swapPayload -> swaps on destination chain
    2) payLoadData -> need to look into what this consists of

2) Swap n Bridge swapAndBridge() calls
  params:
    BridgeParams calldata _bridgeParams
    bytes calldata _swapPayload
    bytes calldata _payloadData

Mocks To Create
-----------------
Think we need to mock messaging system.

1) Layerzero messaging system
  - Mock the calls that come into sgReceive()
